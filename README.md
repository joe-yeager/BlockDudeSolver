# BlockDudeSolver
An automated solver for Block Dude using heuristic search and constraint satisfaction.

##Build Instructions:
###Install the graphics libraries:
`sudo apt-get install python-tk`
`sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk`

###Run the program:
  ####Test sets:
    `python solver.py test`
  ####Game:
    `python solver.py game`
  ####Both:
    `python solver.py test game`
  ####Both with pauses in between levels:
    `python solver.py test game pause`

The program requires python 2.7 due to dependencies, so if any of the above commands fail try replacing python with python2.7
